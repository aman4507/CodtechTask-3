Create a database to store product and user information.
Design tables for products, users, sales, and any other necessary data.
Step 3: Implement User Authentication
Create a login interface for users to enter their credentials.
Implement authentication logic to validate user credentials against the database.
Step 4: Develop the GUI
Create main windows and forms for adding, editing, and deleting products.
Develop interfaces for inventory tracking and report generation.
Step 5: Implement Inventory Management Features
Add functionality to add, edit, and delete products in the database.
Track inventory levels and update them based on sales and restocking.
